# BigQuery snippets & Hover docs

BigQuery snippets are borrowed from [vscode-language-sql-bigquery](https://github.com/shinichi-takii/vscode-language-sql-bigquery) VSCode extension. Full credit goes to the author @shinichi-takii.
This plugin adds additional descriptions to some commonly used functions so that we can use it to show on hover docs.
