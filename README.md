### <a id="faq">Frequently asked questions</a>

1. [Unable to execute command e.g. error]() `command vscode-dataform-tools.xxx not found`

   * It is likely that the vscode workspace folder is not opened at the root of your dataform project. For example, if your dataform project is located at `~/Documents/repos/my_dataform_project` ensure that workspace is opened at
   `~/Documents/repos/my_dataform_project` NOT `~/Documents/repos/my_dataform_project`
   * The above design is to facilitate the exection of `dataform compile --json` command without infering the dataform root at run time

2. [Error compiling Dataform, process existed with exit code 1]()
   * Check if correct dataform cli version is installed by running `dataform --version` in your terminal
   * Ensure that dataform cli version matches the version required by the project
   * Try compiling the project by running `dataform compile` on your terminal from the root of your dataform project
   * In case you need to install a specific dataform cli version by running `npm i -g @dataform/cli@2.9.0`. Make sure you verify the version by running the `dataform --version`
   * In case the error is not due to all the above reasons it is likely that you have a compilation error in your pipeline

3. [Dataform encountered an error: Missing credentials JSON file; not found at path <your_project_path>/.df-credentials.json]()
   * Run `dataform init-creds` from the from the root of your dataform project in your terminal
   * You will be promted to pick the location and type of authentication `json/adc`. Choosing adc will be use your default gcp credentials that you had setup using `gcloud`

3. [I do not want to see compiled query each time I save it]()
   * Open vscode settings and search for Dataform and uncheck the following setting
   ![disable_save_on_compile](/media/images/disable_save_on_compile.png)

3. [I want the autocompletion to be of the format  `${ref('dataset_name', 'table_name)}` instead of `${ref('table_name')}` ]()
   * Open vscode settings and search for Dataform and select the prefered autocompletion format
   ![disable_save_on_compile](/media/images/preferred_autocompletion.png)


## Known Issues

- [ ] Features such as go to definition / dependancy graph might not work with consistantly with `${ref("dataset", "table")}`
- [ ] sync feature flickers when user tries to scroll a non-active editor. Fixes when user selects the active editor by clicking on it

## TODO

- [ ] Use `.sqlx` specific grammar. [Docs on how to do it](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide)
- [ ] Preview query results in a table
- [ ] Bundle javascript files in the extension using [esbuild or webpack](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/bundling-extension)
- [ ] Handle case where user is not connected to internet or on vpn where network request for dry run cannot be made
- [ ] Add proper logging, [winston-transport-vscode](https://github.com/loderunner/winston-transport-vscode)
